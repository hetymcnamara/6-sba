Hello! Welcome to my SBA assignment. You will find that the program meets all the requirements:

Declare variables properly using let and const where appropriate.
Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.
Use strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables.
Use at least two if statements to control program flow.
Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.
Utilize at least two different types of loops.
Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue.
Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects.
Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object.
Use functions to handle repeated tasks.
Program outputs processed data as described above. Partial credit will be earned depending on the level of adherence to the described behavior.
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
Commit frequently to the git repository.
Include a README file that contains a description of your application.

Thank you so mcuch for stopping by!
